HX-HE2 Traffic Counting Java Application
Overview
This Java application is designed for HX-HE2 devices that count traffic. It listens to a TCP server at port 9000, accepts new connections, and responds with the current timestamp and other information (Package Instruction). The received data is processed using tcp5g.datahandler.java, while the package instruction is handled in hearhandler.java. The application also supports firmware upgrades.

Prerequisites
Maven installed on your machine
Building and Running
To build the project, use the following Maven command:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install -DskipTests
To run the application, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
java -jar Demo-Snapshot.jar
Usage
Make sure the HX-HE2 devices are configured to communicate with the specified TCP server and port (9000).
Run the Java application using the provided JAR file.
The application will listen for incoming connections, respond with the current timestamp, and handle data accordingly.
Code Structure
tcp5g.datahandler.java: Handles the processing of incoming data.
hearhandler.java: Handles the package instruction logic.
Additional improvements include support for firmware upgrades.
Database Integration
The code allows for easy integration with a database. You can edit the code to insert data directly into the database.
